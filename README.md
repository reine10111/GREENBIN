"Turning Trash into Treasures"

# ‚ùì WHAT IS GREENBIN?
The GreenBin project is an innovative waste management platform designed to revolutionize how communities handle their waste. By assigning value to recyclable materials, incentivizing responsible waste disposal, and facilitating collaboration between individuals and barangay officials, GreenBin aims to create a sustainable and environmentally-friendly approach to waste management.

# ‚ùì WHY GREENBIN IS USEFUL?
The GreenBin project offers several benefits to both users and communities. Firstly, it encourages individuals to dispose of their waste responsibly by rewarding them for their actions. This not only promotes environmental responsibility but also helps keep communities clean. Additionally, by partnering with barangay officials, GreenBin creates a sustainable revenue stream for communities through the sale of recyclable materials, contributing to economic growth and development.
